# Purpose
Open Source Options (OSO) is dedicated to teaching how to use freely available, open-source tools for programming and data analysis.

# Content
Content on this website and our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSeGDrlScCNgBcN5C8nTEw) will always be free.

We also offer paid courses at opensourceoptions.teachable.com. These courses are well organized, guide you sequentially through tasks, and result in a useful product. Additionally, you will have more access to, and receive more communication from, Open Source Options instructors. Our goal is to keep the price of paid courses low. Subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSeGDrlScCNgBcN5C8nTEw) for announcements on the newest courses and for discount codes and giveaways.
