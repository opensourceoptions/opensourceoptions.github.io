# Website content
opensourceoptions.com will mainly host step-by-step tutorials teaching how to implement various data sciece techniques with open source software. These tutorials will be enhanced with videos posted to our YouTube Channel. Some content will also be hosted on [udemy.com](udemy.com), which hosts thousands of courses. Most Udemy courses are sold for profit.

## Why paid content?
After my talk about all these free options you may be wondering why you have to pay for the OSO courses hosted on Udemy. I have a couple of reasons. 

First, I frequently get questions or requests on social media platforms. Most of these are requests for videos or tutorials on a certain topic or how to troubleshoot a specific problem. I don't have time or incentive to respond to most of these questions, comments, and requests. Paid courses require me to effectively communicate information, and be available to respond to students when they have issues. Because the students are paying I have a responsibility to help them with the material, and am compensated for my extra efforts.

Second, before you pay for a course on Udemy, you may (and should) look at similar courses to see if there is something else that would better fit your needs. This helps serious students find what they are looking for.

## Content pricing
While the Udemy content is not free, I will provide several free coupons for each course, and a large number of discount coupons. I want to make learning affordable for those wishing to participate.

## If you don't want to pay
I dont blame you! I'm often the person that expects all the information to be free. For that reason the majority of the information in Udemy courses will be available on OSO or the YouTube Channel. These tutorials and videos will not be as organized or go as deep as the Udemy courses, but will provide you with very similar information. I honestly try to respond to all serious questions, inquiries, and requests, but my response time is often slow.
