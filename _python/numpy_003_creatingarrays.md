# Creating a simple array
After `numpy` is installed we can begin to create arrays. First, we'll need to import `numpy` into our python project. Here I use the statement, `import numpy as np`, to limit my typing later. This code will allow me to use `np` in my script to represent instead of typing the full `numpy` everytime. Then, we can create a simpy array by calling `np.array()`. The values in the parentheses will become the values in our array.

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
a = np.array(1)
print a
{% endhighlight %}

This code block gives us the result below. An array containing the single value `1`.

{% highlight python %}
1
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
{% endhighlight %}
