# Requirements
- Python version 2.7 or greater
- Beginner skills with python
- Desire to learn `numpy`

# Objectives
1. Teach the basics of using `numpy` in python
2. Provide data science applications of `numpy`
3. Introduce advanced `numpy` numpy concepts

# What is numpy?
`numpy` is a powerful python package for handling arrays. It uses `C` libraries to optimize procedures that would otherwise be slow/computationally expensive in python.

## What can I do with numpy?
The possibilities are almost endless. Arrays are used in many applications from photography to economic analysis. Data objects that are composed of multiple values, arrays will be used, and `numpy` is the python standard for working with arrays. 

Personally, I use `numpy` most for spatial data analysis. I do a lot of work with spatial raster datasets and spatially referenced aerial photographs. `numpy` is the basic package I use for manipulating these datasets and doing many different analyses.
